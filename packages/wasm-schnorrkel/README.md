# @plugnet/wasm-schnorrkel

A fork of [@parity/schnorrkel-js](https://github.com/polkadot-js/schnorrkel-js/tree/b1a1bf25be7397d3c21bba5ddde14286a58b269c) that allows proper operation against all the environments that the `@plugnet/api` supports. Changes from the base repo -

- WASM initialisation is done async, via Promise (this allows for clear operation in webpack environments without additional workers)
- WASM outputs are optimised via `wasm-opt` from the [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) project
- Output bundle is wrapped with camelCase names (not including the `__***` internal functions)
- Full named function definitions for TypeScript
- Requires for crypto is wrapped, removing the "on-demand-require" warnings in webpack-based environments
- WASM output is done via a base-64 encoded string, supporting both Node.js and browser environments
- Code cleanups and addition of functions required for all sr25519 operations
- Extended tests to cover Rust, wasm (via Node) and wasm (via jest), removed the (here unused) www test interfaces
- TextDecoder is polyfilled by using the version from `@plugnet/util` (consistent support, also on React Native)
- Polyfill for crypto functions that are not available in some environments (e.g. Jest & React Native)

## Usage

Install the package (also requires `@plugnet/util` for `TextEncoder` polyfills - not included here as a dependency to keep the tree lean)

`yarn add @plugnet/wasm-schnorrkel @plugnet/util`

Use it -

```js
const { u8aToHex } = require('@plugnet/util');
const { waitReady, keypairFromSeed } = require('@plugnet/wasm-schnorrkel');

async function main () {
  // first wait until the WASM has been loaded (async init)
  await waitReady();

  // generate keypair via all-0 seed
  const pair = keypairFromSeed(new Uint8Array(32));

  // extract the parts
  const secretKey = pair.subarray(0, 64);
  const publicKey = pair.subarray(64, 96);

  // display
  console.log('publicKey:', u8aToHex(publicKey));
  console.log('secretKey:', u8aToHex(secretKey));
}
```

## future work

Support asm.js for environments (like React Native) that doesn't have WASM support. Initial attempts made at this, but not active.
